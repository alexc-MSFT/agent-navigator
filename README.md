# Agent Navigator Copilot Agent <img align="right" src="assets/agent-navigator-logo.png" alt="Agent Navigator logo" width="120">
Agent Navigator is a Copilot Agent built in Copilot Studio Lite designed to help users discover and learn about Copilot agents.  

It helps you explore:
- **Public agents** available in the Agent Store
- **Organisation/Shared agents** available within your organisation

This repository contains **setup documentation and instructions** for building the agent in your own Copilot environment.  
No code is included.

## 🌐 Knowledge Sources

By default, **Agent Navigator is web grounded** only, allowing it to be used by all Copilot users for free including Copilot Chat (unlicensed users). 
It uses the following site to list available Copilot agents:

👉 [Copilot Agent Directory](https://agentdirectory.sharepointalex.uk/index.html)

⚠️ **Important Note:**  
This is **not an official Microsoft website**. It is a community-driven project maintained in a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexc-msft/copilot-agent-directory).  

For production use, customers are strongly advised to **create and host their own version** of this site (or an equivalent internal resource - ideally web hosted so it can be used by unlicensed users) and ground Agent Navigator in that data source.
